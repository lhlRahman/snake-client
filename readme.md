# Snake Client Project

Snake Client is a multiplayer version of the classic Snake game. In this game, players control a snake that grows in length by consuming pieces of food. The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, which leads to game over.

This project serves as the client-side of the Snake game. It connects to the Snake server, receives game data, and allows users to control their snake in real-time.
